# CoreSolution
Core Solution is a demo project for all the newbies out these who wants to learn ASP.Net Core with all the basic implementations for Middleware, Authentication, Swagger, Swagger testing with Bearer Authentication, etc. 

This is what I think should be a base for creating any basic project and this should act as default setup. 

I have taken help from several other websites which I do not remeber and hence I do not take credit for the whole project.

Any suggestions or modification, please do let me know. I'm very much open on this for betterment of this code/project.

Happy Coding!
